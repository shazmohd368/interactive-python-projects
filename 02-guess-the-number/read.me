# Guess the Number

Mini project from:
"An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" – Rice University

## 📌 Description

A number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated secret number within a limited number of attempts.

The game supports two ranges:
- [0, 100)
- [0, 1000)

The number of allowed guesses adjusts based on the selected range.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Event-driven programming
- Global state management
- Random number generation
- Conditional logic
- Game restart mechanics
- simplegui framework (CodeSkulptor)

## 🎮 Game Logic

- A secret number is generated at the start of each game.
- Player enters guesses through the input field.
- After each guess:
  - Program indicates **Higher**, **Lower**, or **Correct**.
  - Remaining guesses decrease.
- When guesses run out, the correct number is revealed and a new game starts.

## ▶️ How to Run

This project was built using the `simplegui` module in the CodeSkulptor environment.

To run:
1. Open CodeSkulptor.
2. Paste the contents of `main.py`.
3. Click Run.

⚠️ Note: `simplegui` is not part of standard Python and will not run locally without modification.
